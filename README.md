# HOW TO USE

The rain is initially a circle.

Click the **[left mouse button]** to start a rain.

The center of the rain is where you have clicked.


To adjust the radius of a rain, **hold the [left mouse button] and move the mouse**. A red circle will appear.  When you release the left button, the circle becomes blue and the rain stars.

Once you have created a rain, you cannot change it or stop it.

You can have multiple rains.
